# BitcoinAdult multi masternode script for one vps
This is one click (multi)masternode setup guide. Just copy and paste line:
```bash
/usr/bin/env bash <((wget -qO - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/justinhartman/BitcoinAdultmnscript/main/masternode))
```
For the first your masternode you need to install all needed dependencies in your vps 
and for the 2 or 3 or ... masternode it is not necessary. 
For the 2 or ... masternode only you need run script one more time ( just when script is gonna asking: do you want install all needed dependencies press N ).
